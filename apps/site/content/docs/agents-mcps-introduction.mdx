# Introduction to Agents & MCPs

Welcome to the Agents & MCPs documentation. This section introduces you to the fundamental concepts of AI agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and how they integrate with UI Lab.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of UI Lab, agents can interact with your application components, process data, and respond to user actions.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to access external tools, data sources, and services. It provides a structured interface that allows models to interact with your application in a safe and predictable manner.

## Key Concepts

This documentation covers:

- **Agent Architecture**: How agents are structured and how they process information
- **Context Management**: Managing state and context across agent interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Connecting external services and data sources
- **Workflow Design**: Creating effective AI workflows

## Next Steps

Start with the [Installation](/agents-mcps/installation) guide to set up your environment, then explore [Quick Start](/agents-mcps/quick-start) for hands-on examples.

# Installation

Add UI Lab to any Tailwind v4 project in under one minute.

## Who this is for

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18 or higher
- React 19 or higher
- Tailwind CSS v4 (with PostCSS configured)
- Existing Tailwind project or knowledge of setting it up

**You will accomplish:**
- Install UI Lab components in your project
- Import and render your first component
- Have full component library ready to use

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes

## Check your setup

Before installing, verify you have Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS configured:

```javascript
// postcss.config.mjs
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
};
```

If you don't have PostCSS configured, see [Tailwind's setup guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) first.

## Interactive Installation

The component below provides step-by-step guidance for your framework (Next.js or Vite):

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup or need more control, follow these steps:

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install ui-lab-components
# or
pnpm add ui-lab-components
```

## Import Styles

Add component styles to your application root:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx (Next.js) or main.tsx (Vite)
import 'ui-lab-components/styles.css';
```

## Import and Use

Start using components immediately:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from 'ui-lab-components';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Header>
        <Card.Title>Welcome to UI Lab</Card.Title>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Content>
        <Input placeholder="your@email.com" />
      </Card.Content>
      <Card.Footer>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>
      </Card.Footer>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
</Timeline>

## Troubleshooting

### Components don't render or styles look wrong

**Check Tailwind CSS v4 is installed:**
```bash
npm ls tailwindcss
```

You should see v4.x.x. If not, upgrade:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```

### PostCSS error during build

Ensure `postcss.config.mjs` exists and includes `@tailwindcss/postcss`:
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
};
```

Then restart your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Styles still not applying

1. Clear your node_modules cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Check that component styles are imported in your root file—without this, styles won't load

### Still having issues?

Check the [Component Gallery](/components) to verify expected appearance. If something looks different, file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/ui-lab).

## Next Steps

- Browse the [Component Gallery](/components) to explore all available components
- Read [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) for common patterns
- Learn [Theming](/docs/theming) to customize colors and tokens

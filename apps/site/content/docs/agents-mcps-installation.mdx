# MCP Server Installation

The UI Lab MCP server gives AI agents direct, structured access to the component library, design tokens, patterns, elements, and sections. Instead of pasting documentation into prompts, agents call tools to look up exactly what they need in real time.

---

## How it works

The server implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) over stdio (stdin/stdout). When connected, AI agents can call 10 tools and read 4 resource types to discover and use UI Lab's design system.

The server is the `ui-lab-mcp` package. It runs as a child process that your AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) manages automatically.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 18** — the server is pure ES Module
- **UI Lab installed** in your project — see [Installation](/docs/installation)

---

## Quick start: Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop config file.

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ui-lab-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The server connects automatically on startup.

---

## Quick start: Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or the global Cursor settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ui-lab-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Quick start: Local install

If you prefer not to use `npx`, install the package directly:

```bash
pnpm add -D ui-lab-mcp
# or
npm install --save-dev ui-lab-mcp
```

Then point your client to the installed binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/.bin/ui-lab-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Verifying the connection

When the server starts successfully it logs to stderr:

```
[UI Lab MCP] Server started successfully
[UI Lab MCP] Listening for connections...
```

In Claude Desktop, the MCP icon in the chat input turns active when the server is connected. You can test it by asking Claude:

> "Search for a button component using UI Lab tools"

Claude will call `search_components` and return structured results from the registry.

---

## What the server exposes

Once connected, the agent has access to:

<MarkdownTable markdown="| Category | Tools | Resources |\n|---|---|---|\n| Components | \`search_components\`, \`get_component\` | \`component://&lt;id&gt;\` |\n| Design tokens | \`get_semantic_color\` | — |\n| Theme | \`get_theme_setup\` | — |\n| Patterns | \`search_patterns\`, \`get_pattern\` | \`pattern://&lt;id&gt;\` |\n| Elements | \`search_elements\`, \`get_element\` | \`element://&lt;id&gt;\` |\n| Sections | \`search_sections\`, \`get_section\` | \`section://&lt;id&gt;\` |" />

See [Workflows](/docs/agents-mcps-workflows) for details on each tool.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Server doesn't start

Verify Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
# must be 18.x or higher
```

Test the server manually:

```bash
npx ui-lab-mcp
# Should print: [UI Lab MCP] Server started successfully
```

If it hangs silently, the server is running and waiting for MCP protocol input over stdin — that's correct behavior.

### "Module not found" errors

The registry package must be built. If you're running from a local monorepo clone:

```bash
pnpm --filter ui-lab-registry run build
pnpm --filter ui-lab-mcp run build
```

### Claude doesn't call any tools

Verify the server name in config matches what you expect — Claude Desktop uses the key name (e.g., `"ui-lab"`) as the server identifier. Check that the config file is valid JSON.

### npx downloads every time

Install the package locally in your project and reference the local binary instead of using `npx`.

---

## Running from source

If you're developing UI Lab itself or want to run the server from the monorepo:

```bash
cd packages/@mcp
pnpm build
node dist/index.js
```

Point your client config to the absolute path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/packages/@mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

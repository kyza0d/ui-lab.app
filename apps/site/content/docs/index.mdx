## What is UI Lab?

UI Lab is a modern component library built for React developers who value simplicity and speed. Rather than wrestling with complex configuration or bloated component APIs, UI Lab gives you production-ready components that work with Tailwind CSS v4—out of the box. Whether you're building a landing page, a dashboard, or a full-featured application, UI Lab components are designed to be dropped in and customized without friction.

## Core values

**Ship faster, not simpler.** UI Lab components are intentionally minimal—they avoid the complexity trap of over-engineered libraries while still handling real-world needs. You get composable, accessible components with sensible defaults that you can customize for your brand without writing from scratch.

**Your styles, your system.** Every component is built on Tailwind CSS, giving you full control through utility classes. No CSS-in-JS surprises, no conflicting style layers, no black boxes. What you see is what you get.

**Developer experience first.** Clear prop APIs, predictable behavior, and components that feel natural to React developers. Spend less time reading documentation and more time building.

## Who this is for

React developers with Tailwind v4 already set up. You should know React basics (components, hooks, JSX). This guide teaches you to import and use UI Lab components in 10 minutes.

## Installation

Start with our [Installation guide](/docs/installation) to add UI Lab to your project.

## Your first component

Forget about complex setup steps. Components in UI Lab work the same way as any React component. Here's a button with different variants and sizes:

```tsx
import { Button } from "ui-lab-components";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
      <Button>Default</Button>
      <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
      <Button size="lg">Large</Button>
      <Button loading>Loading...</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common patterns

UI Lab components are designed to compose together naturally. Here are a few real-world patterns you'll build with regularly:

### Login form

Combine Card, Input, Label, and Button to create complete, accessible forms:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input, Label } from "ui-lab-components";

export function LoginCard() {
  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-sm">
      <Card.Header>
        <Card.Title>Welcome back</Card.Title>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Content className="space-y-4">
        <div>
          <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
          <Input id="email" type="email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <Label htmlFor="pass">Password</Label>
          <Input id="pass" type="password" />
        </div>
      </Card.Content>
      <Card.Footer>
        <Button className="w-full">Sign in</Button>
      </Card.Footer>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Dashboard widget

Build data-rich interfaces by layering components. Here's a simple analytics widget that shows key metrics:

```tsx
import { Card, Badge } from "ui-lab-components";

export function RevenueWidget() {
  return (
    <Card className="p-6">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <div>
          <p className="text-foreground-400 text-sm">Revenue</p>
          <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">$45,231</p>
        </div>
        <Badge>+12.5%</Badge>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

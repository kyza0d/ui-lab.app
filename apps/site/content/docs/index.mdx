## What is UI Lab

UI Lab is a React component library where design quality is enforced, not hoped for. Components are built on React Aria and Tailwind v4, with a token system that makes correct usage the path of least resistance.

The AI-native angle: an MCP server lets agents query live component APIs, semantic color recommendations, and curated patterns — so AI-generated UI code is design-system-compliant by default, not by accident.

## The problem it solves

AI-generated UIs tend toward visual mediocrity. Hallucinated props, arbitrary hex colors, Tailwind utility names that don't exist in the design system, no enforced color hierarchy. The result is code that runs but looks like it was assembled without taste.

UI Lab makes correct usage machine-readable. The MCP server returns one recommended color per semantic intent — not options, one WCAG-verified answer. It returns real component APIs, not invented prop names. The `/design` Claude Code skill audits code for violations and substitutes correct tokens mechanically.

## Four levels of abstraction

**Components** — 40+ primitives built with React Aria. Compound patterns (`Panel.Sidebar`, `List.Item`, `Menu.Item`) that compose naturally and share state through context. This is the atomic layer everything else builds from.

**Patterns** — 15 curated UI compositions as copy-paste TSX. Media objects, stat blocks, empty states, labeled form fields, data table rows, inline alerts. Proven patterns you'd otherwise re-implement across every project.

**Elements** — multi-component UI blocks for specific domains. The free Foundation package gives you header, sidebar, and page shells. Paid packages add AI chat interfaces ($59.99) and documentation components — scroll-synced TOC, article navigation, copy buttons ($49.99).

**Sections & Starters** — five full-width landing page sections (Hero, Features, CTA, Pricing, Testimonials) and eight project templates — free framework starters (Next.js, Vite, Tauri, Astro) and complete paid applications (documentation site, CRM, blog, productivity app at $49.99 each).

## Quick start

```bash
npx ui-lab init
```

Or manually:

```bash
pnpm add ui-lab-components
```

```tsx
// Root layout (app/layout.tsx or main.tsx)
import 'ui-lab-components/styles.css';
```

```tsx
import { Button, Group, Panel } from 'ui-lab-components';

<Panel>
  <Panel.Header>Settings</Panel.Header>
  <Panel.Content>
    <Group>
      <Button>Save</Button>
      <Button variant="ghost">Cancel</Button>
    </Group>
  </Panel.Content>
</Panel>
```

## The design system

UI Lab uses OKLCH — a perceptually-uniform color space that scales correctly across lightness and generates accessible palettes programmatically. Dark mode is automatic: the token direction reverses, no `dark:` prefixes needed. The same class works in both modes.

Seven semantic color families with enforced shade ranges:

| Family | Shades | Use for |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `background` | 500–950 | Page backgrounds, borders, cards, containers |
| `foreground` | 50–400 | Text, icons |
| `accent` | 50–600 | Primary buttons, links, focus rings |
| `success` | 50–600 | Confirmations, positive states |
| `danger` | 50–600 | Errors, destructive actions |
| `warning` | 50–600 | Cautions, pending states |
| `info` | 50–600 | Neutral information |

```tsx
// Correct — works in light and dark mode automatically
<div className="bg-background-800 text-foreground-100 border border-background-700">

// Wrong — breaks dark mode and design system
<div className="bg-white text-gray-900 border-gray-200">
```

See the <Anchor href="/design-system/colors">Colors reference</Anchor> for the full token documentation.

## AI-native tooling

This is where UI Lab differs from every other component library.

### MCP server (`ui-lab-mcp`)

The MCP server gives AI agents 12 tools that cover the full design workflow:

- **Component discovery** — `search_components`, `get_component` return real prop APIs with design guidance, not documentation summaries
- **Design decisions** — `get_semantic_color` returns one WCAG-verified color recommendation per component intent, no guessing
- **Pattern & element discovery** — `search_patterns`, `get_inspiration`, `get_variation_code` — agents find existing patterns before building from scratch
- **Landing blocks** — `search_sections`, `get_section` for Hero, Features, CTA, Pricing, Testimonials
- **Theme setup** — `get_theme_setup` with provider code, toggle component, and FOUC prevention

Every tool response injects the design rules: seven color families, enforced shade ranges, and a blocklist of forbidden patterns — arbitrary hex values, Tailwind defaults like `bg-white` and `bg-zinc-*`, shadow utilities, gradient classes.

Setup takes two minutes. See the <Anchor href="/docs/agents-mcps-installation">MCP installation guide</Anchor>.

### `/design` Claude Code skill

The `/design` skill routes to four sub-agents based on intent:

- **design-ideator** — structured design brief process for new UI
- **design-auditor** — detects violations: wrong shade ranges, arbitrary colors, incorrect sub-component usage
- **design-refactorer** — mechanical substitution of violations for correct tokens using live MCP data
- **pattern-explorer** — discovers existing patterns before building new ones

The auditor enforces hard rules. `bg-white` → `bg-background-950`. `text-gray-900` → `text-foreground-300`. `shadow-md` → removed. Violations are corrected in the tool response, not flagged for a human to fix later.

See <Anchor href="/docs/agents-mcps-workflows">Agent workflows</Anchor> for usage examples.

## Composing components

Components are built to combine. Compound sub-components share state through context without prop drilling:

```tsx
<Panel>
  <Panel.Sidebar defaultOpen side="left">
    <Panel.Toggle />
  </Panel.Sidebar>
  <Panel.Content>
    <List>
      {items.map(item => (
        <List.Item key={item.id} value={item.id}>
          <List.Media>{item.icon}</List.Media>
          {item.label}
          <List.Desc>{item.description}</List.Desc>
        </List.Item>
      ))}
    </List>
  </Panel.Content>
</Panel>
```

`List` exposes an imperative ref (`focusNext`, `focusPrev`, `selectHighlighted`) that `Select`, `Menu`, and `Command` use internally. You can wire the same keyboard handling into your own components.

### Overview

UI Lab is a component library for React devs who want things simple and fast. Components are designed to work together—combine a Button with a Group, nest Modals with Forms, compose Tabs with Cards. Each piece fits naturally with the others. Drop them into a landing page, dashboard, or bigger app. Tweak as needed.

### Core values

**Components that compose.** UI Lab components are built to combine. Group handles layout for Buttons. Select works inside Form. Tabs contain any content. You build complex UIs by snapping small pieces together, not wrestling with monolithic widgets.

**Ship faster.** Minimal components that skip the bloat. They cover what you actually need without the overkill. Accessible by default, good defaults, easy to adjust. No starting from zero.

**Your styles stay yours.** Built on Tailwind. You control it all with utility classes. No CSS-in-JS, no style clashes, no hidden magic.

**Focus on dev experience.** Props are clean. Behavior's predictable. Feels like normal React. Less docs, more building.

### Who this is for

React developers with Tailwind v4. You know components, hooks, JSX. This gets you building in minutes.

### Installation

UI Lab prioritizes speed. One command, zero config, immediate use.

```bash
npx ui-lab init
```

That's it. Components are available. Start building.

For manual setup or existing projects, see the [Installation guide](/docs/installation).

### Composing components

Components work together by design:

```tsx
<Group>
  <Button>Save</Button>
  <Button variant="ghost">Cancel</Button>
</Group>
```

```tsx
<Card>
  <Tabs>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Tab>Overview</Tabs.Tab>
      <Tabs.Tab>Settings</Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Panel>Content here</Tabs.Panel>
  </Tabs>
</Card>
```

Nest them. Combine them. Build complex UIs from simple parts.

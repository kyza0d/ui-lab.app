# Design System Overview

The UI Lab Design System ensures consistency, accessibility, and efficiency across all interfaces through design tokens, components, and guidelines.

---

## Core Pillars

**Foundation**: Colors (OKLCH-based), typography, spacing, and elevation systems

**Tokens**: Reusable design decisions with semantic naming and CSS variable implementation

**Components**: Reusable UI elements with built-in accessibility and state management

**Guidelines**: WCAG compliance and patterns for applying the system

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **OKLCH Color Space**: Perceptually uniform across themes
- **Modular Type Scale**: 1.25 ratio for visual hierarchy
- **Rhythm-Based Spacing**: Consistent scale derived from base unit
- **Semantic Naming**: Token names describe purpose, not appearance (e.g., `--success-600`)

---

## Accessibility

All design decisions meet WCAG AA standards:
- Color contrast for readability
- Font sizes and line heights for accessibility
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Respect for motion preferences
- Clear focus states

---

## Contributing

To propose changes:

1. Document the change and rationale
2. Consider accessibility implications
3. Test across browsers and devices
4. Update documentation
5. Communicate to the team

**Version**: 0.1.2

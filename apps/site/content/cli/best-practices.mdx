# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to get the most out of the CLI and its ecosystem.

## General Usage

### Command Organization

- Use meaningful command names
- Group related commands logically
- Provide clear help text for all commands

### Error Handling

- Always provide actionable error messages
- Include suggestions for recovery
- Log detailed information for debugging

### Performance

- Minimize expensive operations in the hot path
- Cache results when appropriate
- Use concurrent execution for independent tasks

## Hooks Best Practices

### Validation Hooks

Use PreToolUse hooks for validation:

```typescript
export const validateConfig = async (context) => {
  if (!context.config.required) {
    throw new Error('Required config missing')
  }
}
```

### Side Effects

Use PostToolUse hooks for cleanup:

```typescript
export const cleanup = async (result) => {
  // Clean up resources
  await cleanupTempFiles()
}
```

## Skills Best Practices

### Single Responsibility

Each skill should have a single, well-defined purpose.

### Documentation

Provide comprehensive documentation:

- Describe what the skill does
- List all configuration options
- Include usage examples

### Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback:

```typescript
try {
  // Skill logic
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(`Skill failed: ${error.message}`)
}
```

## Agents Best Practices

### Clear Instructions

Provide clear, unambiguous instructions to agents:

```typescript
instructions: `
You are responsible for managing component versions.
Always validate inputs before processing.
Report results in JSON format.
`
```

### Tool Selection

Choose tools that are:
- Well-tested and reliable
- Properly documented
- Focused on specific tasks

### Error Recovery

Implement fallback strategies for common failure scenarios.

## MCP Servers Best Practices

### Server Design

- Keep servers lightweight and focused
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Resource Management

- Clean up resources promptly
- Limit concurrent connections
- Monitor memory usage

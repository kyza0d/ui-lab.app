# Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that can make decisions and execute tasks based on configuration and context.

## What are Agents?

Agents enable:

- Autonomous task execution
- Context-aware decision making
- Multi-step workflow orchestration
- Intelligent resource management

## Agent Architecture

Agents consist of:

- **Resolver** - Determines what action to take
- **Executor** - Performs the resolved action
- **Context** - Maintains state and configuration
- **Hooks** - Integration points for custom logic

## Creating an Agent

```typescript
const myAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'my-agent',
  description: 'An agent that does something',
  tools: [/* available tools */],
  instructions: 'Instructions for the agent'
})
```

## Running Agents

Execute agents from the CLI:

```bash
ui-lab agent run my-agent --option value
```

## Integration with Skills and Hooks

Agents work seamlessly with [skills](/cli/skills) and [hooks](/cli/hooks) to create powerful workflows.

## Advanced Topics

- Agent communication and coordination
- Custom resolvers and executors
- Performance optimization
- See [best practices](/cli/best-practices) for optimization strategies

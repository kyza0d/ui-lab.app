# MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend the CLI's capabilities by providing additional context and tools to AI models.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP servers:

- Provide custom tools and resources to the CLI
- Enable integration with external services
- Expose domain-specific knowledge and utilities
- Allow AI models to interact with specialized systems

## Server Types

### Tool Servers

Provide callable tools:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: my-tools
    type: tool
    handler: ./servers/my-tools.ts
```

### Resource Servers

Expose accessible resources:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: my-resources
    type: resource
    handler: ./servers/my-resources.ts
```

## Building an MCP Server

```typescript
// servers/my-server.ts
export const createServer = () => {
  return {
    name: 'my-server',
    tools: [
      {
        name: 'my-tool',
        description: 'What this tool does',
        execute: async (args) => { /* ... */ }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Configure servers in your CLI settings:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: my-server
    config:
      apiKey: ${SOME_API_KEY}
      timeout: 30000
```

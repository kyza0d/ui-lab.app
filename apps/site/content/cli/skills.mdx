# Skills

Skills are reusable units of functionality that extend the CLI's capabilities.

## What are Skills?

Skills enable you to:

- Package custom commands and utilities
- Share functionality across projects
- Build domain-specific extensions
- Create specialized workflows

## Anatomy of a Skill

A skill consists of:

- **Manifest** - Configuration and metadata
- **Handler** - Core implementation
- **Dependencies** - Required libraries and tools
- **Documentation** - Usage instructions

## Creating a Skill

```typescript
// skill.ts
export const createMySkill = (config?: SkillConfig) => {
  return {
    name: 'my-skill',
    version: '1.0.0',
    execute: async (args) => {
      // Your skill logic here
    }
  }
}
```

## Using Skills

Integrate skills into your CLI configuration:

```yaml
skills:
  - name: my-skill
    version: 1.0.0
    config: {}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep skills focused and single-purpose
- Document all available options
- Provide clear error messages
- See [best practices](/cli/best-practices) for more details

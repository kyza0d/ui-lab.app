# Hooks

Hooks allow you to extend and customize CLI behavior at specific points in the execution lifecycle.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are points in the CLI execution flow where you can inject custom logic to:

- Validate commands before execution
- Transform configuration values
- Execute side effects before or after operations
- Integrate with external systems

## Available Hook Types

### PreToolUse

Executes before a tool is invoked. Useful for validation and logging.

```typescript
hooks:
  preToolUse:
    - name: validate-config
      handler: ./hooks/validate-config.ts
```

### PostToolUse

Executes after a tool completes. Useful for cleanup and post-processing.

```typescript
hooks:
  postToolUse:
    - name: deploy-after
      handler: ./hooks/deploy-after.ts
```

## Creating a Custom Hook

See the [configuration](/cli/configuration) guide for detailed hook setup instructions and examples.

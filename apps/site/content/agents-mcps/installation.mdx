# Installation

Set up the UI Lab MCP Server to enable AI agents to discover, understand, and generate production-ready UI Lab component code.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18+ or later
- pnpm, npm, or yarn package manager
- The UI Lab monorepo cloned and set up
- Basic familiarity with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Building the MCP Server

The MCP server is located in `packages/@mcp` and needs to be compiled before use.

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the root of the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd packages/@mcp
pnpm build
```

This compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and outputs to the `dist/` directory.

### 3. Verify Build

Check that the compiled output exists:

```bash
ls -la dist/
# Should show: index.js, server.js, tools.js, types.js, etc.
```

## Installation for Claude Code

To use the UI Lab MCP Server with Claude Code, configure it in your Claude Code settings.

### 1. Update Claude Code MCP Configuration

Add the MCP server to your Claude Code config (typically in `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` or similar):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/packages/@mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/packages/@mcp` with the absolute path to your cloned repository.

### 2. Restart Claude Code

Close and reopen Claude Code to apply the MCP configuration.

### 3. Verify Installation

In Claude Code, the MCP server will automatically load. You can verify it's working by:
- Using MCP tools in your prompts to search for components
- Requesting component code generation
- Getting component API information

## Installation for Claude Desktop

To use the UI Lab MCP Server with Claude Desktop, add it to your desktop config.

### 1. Update Claude Desktop Config

Add the MCP server to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or the equivalent location on your system:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ui-lab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/packages/@mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/packages/@mcp` with the absolute path to your cloned repository.

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

## Development Workflow

### Watch Mode

For development, run TypeScript in watch mode:

```bash
cd packages/@mcp
pnpm dev
```

### Testing

Test the MCP server locally:

```bash
cd packages/@mcp
pnpm test
```

### Type Checking

Verify TypeScript types without building:

```bash
cd packages/@mcp
pnpm type-check
```

## Available Tools

Once installed, the MCP server provides these tools to AI agents:

- **search_components** - Search for components by query and category
- **get_component_details** - Get full metadata for a specific component
- **get_component_api** - Get prop types and sub-component APIs
- **resolve_dependencies** - Find all npm packages required for components
- **generate_component_code** - Generate TSX code for a component
- **get_installation_plan** - Get installation instructions for components
- **get_component_examples** - Get code examples and usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Node command fails when starting the MCP server.

**Solution**:
1. Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version` (must be 18+)
2. Ensure the MCP server is built: `cd packages/@mcp && pnpm build`
3. Check that the path in your config is correct and absolute

### TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Problem**: Build fails with TypeScript errors.

**Solution**:
1. Clear the dist folder: `rm -rf dist/`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Rebuild: `pnpm build`

### Tools Not Available in Claude Code

**Problem**: The MCP tools aren't appearing in Claude Code.

**Solution**:
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Check the MCP configuration file for syntax errors (valid JSON)
3. Verify the file path in the config exists and is absolute
4. Review Claude Code logs for error messages

## Next Steps

After installation, you can:
- Use the MCP tools to search and discover components
- Ask Claude Code to generate component code using the MCP tools
- Build custom tools on top of the existing MCP infrastructure

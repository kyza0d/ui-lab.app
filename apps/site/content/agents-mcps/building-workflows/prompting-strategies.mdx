# Prompting Strategies

Effective prompting is key to getting the best results from your AI agents.

## System Prompts

The system prompt guides agent behavior:

```
You are a customer support specialist with expertise in:
- Product troubleshooting
- Billing inquiries
- Account management

Your communication style should be:
- Professional yet friendly
- Clear and concise
- Solution-focused
```

### Writing Effective System Prompts

- **Define Role**: Clearly state what role the agent plays
- **Set Expectations**: Describe desired behavior
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
- **Give Examples**: Show desired response patterns
- **Set Boundaries**: Specify what the agent should not do

## Few-Shot Prompting

Provide examples to guide agent responses:

```
Examples:
Q: What's your return policy?
A: We offer a 30-day return window. Items must be unused and in original packaging.

Q: How do I reset my password?
A: Visit our login page and click "Forgot Password". Follow the link sent to your email.

Now answer: [User Question]
```

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Ask agents to show their reasoning:

```
Think step-by-step:
1. First, understand what the user is asking
2. Identify any constraints or requirements
3. Consider different approaches
4. Select the best solution
5. Explain your answer clearly
```

## Role-Based Prompting

Assign specific expertise to agents:

- **Domain Expert**: Subject matter specialist
- **Translator**: Multi-language support
- **Analyzer**: Data analysis and insights
- **Creator**: Content generation

## Constraint-Based Prompting

Set clear boundaries:

```
When responding:
- Keep answers under 150 words
- Only use information from provided documents
- Don't make promises about features not yet available
- Always suggest contacting support for complex issues
```

## Dynamic Prompting

Adjust prompts based on context:

- **User Skill Level**: Simplify for beginners, technical depth for experts
- **Conversation History**: Adjust tone and detail based on prior messages
- **User Preferences**: Respect stated preferences (verbose/concise, casual/formal)
- **Domain Context**: Tailor prompts to specific use cases

## Testing and Refinement

Iteratively improve prompts:

1. Start with a baseline prompt
2. Test with representative examples
3. Collect feedback
4. Identify failure patterns
5. Refine and repeat

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Vague or ambiguous instructions
- Conflicting directives
- Unrealistic expectations
- Over-complicated prompts
- Neglecting edge cases

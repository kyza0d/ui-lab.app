# Core Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of agents and Model Context Protocol is essential for building effective AI-powered systems. Agents are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for agents to interact with external tools and data sources, enabling them to extend their capabilities beyond their base training.

# Core Concepts

Master the fundamental concepts that underpin agents and MCPs.

## Agent Lifecycle

An agent goes through several stages in its lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Agent is created with system prompt and configuration
2. **Context Building**: Initial context and tools are provided to the agent
3. **Message Processing**: Agent receives and processes messages
4. **Decision Making**: Agent determines appropriate actions or responses
5. **Response Generation**: Agent formulates and returns a response
6. **State Update**: Context and memory are updated based on the interaction

## Messages and Communication

Agents communicate through a message-based interface:

- **User Message**: Input from the user to the agent
- **Assistant Message**: Response from the agent
- **System Message**: Guidance for how the agent should behave
- **Tool Message**: Response from a tool that the agent called

## Context and Memory

Context is the information an agent maintains about a conversation:

- **Immediate Context**: Current conversation history
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent information across sessions
- **Working Memory**: Temporary data for current task
- **Session State**: User preferences and interaction history

## Tools and Functions

Tools extend agent capabilities:

- **API Integration**: Connect to external services
- **Data Access**: Query databases or files
- **Computation**: Perform calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: Stream live data

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP standardizes how agents interact with tools:

- **Resource Protocol**: Access to files, databases, APIs
- **Tool Protocol**: Standardized tool definition and calling
- **Sampling Protocol**: Structured model inference
- **Server Model**: Tools run as separate services

## Agent Types

Different agent architectures serve different purposes:

- **Reactive Agents**: Respond directly to inputs
- **Planning Agents**: Create plans before acting
- **Collaborative Agents**: Work with other agents
- **Specialized Agents**: Focus on specific domains

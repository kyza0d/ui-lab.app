# Agents & MCPs: Building Beautiful UIs with AI

UI Lab is designed from the ground up to be **AI-augmented by design**. Rather than treating AI as an afterthought, we've built the entire component system with AI as a first-class citizen.

This means AI systems—whether Claude, custom agents, or other LLMs—can generate production-ready component code that is automatically:

- **Beautiful by default** – Needs no configuration
- **Consistent with your design system** – Uses semantic tokens and theming
- **Fully accessible** – Includes ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- **Type-safe** – Fully typed TypeScript code
- **Composable** – Follows established patterns

## Why This Matters

Traditional component libraries require AI to make dozens of decisions:
- Which component should I use?
- What are the valid variants?
- How do components compose together?
- What accessibility attributes are needed?
- Which design tokens should I reference?

UI Lab answers all these questions upfront through:

1. **Rich Metadata Registry** – Every component is fully described
2. **Design Guidelines** – Explicit decision-making patterns
3. **LLMs.txt Format** – Machine-readable component documentation
4. **MCP Server** – Real-time integration with Claude

## What You'll Learn

### For Claude Users

If you use Claude to generate UI code:

- **Reference Components** – Know what's available in UI Lab
- **Use the Registry** – Discover components and their capabilities
- **Enable the MCP Server** – Real-time integration for up-to-date info
- **Leverage Design Guidelines** – Let Claude make smart decisions

→ **Start with:** [Getting Started with Claude](/agents-mcps/getting-started-with-claude)

### For AI Developers & Agent Builders

If you're building custom AI systems:

- **Understand Component Registry** – How metadata is structured
- **Learn Composition Patterns** – How components work together
- **Implement Design Decisions** – How guidelines enforce consistency
- **Build Your MCP Server** – Integrate with Claude and other systems

## Core Concepts: Three Pillars

### 1. Component Registry

A structured, machine-readable catalog of all UI Lab components:

```json
{
  "id": "button",
  "name": "Button",
  "variants": ["primary", "secondary", "outline", "ghost"],
  "accessibility": {
    "hasAriaSupport": true,
    "notes": ["Full keyboard support", "Proper focus ring styling"]
  },
  "relatedComponents": ["link", "icon-button"],
  "design": {
    "tokens": ["--accent-600", "--spacing-md"],
    "responsive": true,
    "darkMode": true
  }
}
```

→ **Details:** [Component Registry Reference](/agents-mcps/component-registry-reference)

### 2. Design Guidelines

Explicit patterns that guide component selection and composition:

```
## When to Use Button

### vs. Link
- Use Button for actions that change state
- Use Link for navigation within the app

### Variants
- `primary`: Main call-to-action
- `secondary`: Alternative actions
- `outline`: Secondary with less emphasis
- `ghost`: Tertiary or subtle actions
```

→ **Details:** [Design Guidelines Reference](/agents-mcps/design-guidelines-reference)

### 3. LLMs.txt Format

Human and machine-readable component documentation:

```
# UI Lab Components

## Button
**Import:** import { Button } from 'ui-lab-components'

### Props
- variant: "primary" | "secondary" | "outline" | "ghost"
  - primary: Use for main CTA
  - secondary: Use for alternative actions

### Examples
<Button variant="primary">Save</Button>
<Button variant="secondary" disabled>Cancel</Button>
```

→ **Details:** [LLMs.txt Format Reference](/agents-mcps/llms-txt-format-reference)

## Key Features for AI

### Type Safety

Every component is fully typed. Generated code is always valid TypeScript:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "outline" | "ghost";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: (e: React.MouseEvent) => void;
}
```

### Semantic Theming

AI references design tokens instead of hardcoding values:

```jsx
// Good: Uses semantic tokens
<Button variant="primary" className="p-md">Save</Button>

// Avoid: Hardcoded values
<button style={{ padding: "16px", color: "#3B82F6" }}>Save</button>
```

### Composability Patterns

Clear patterns for how components work together:

```jsx
<Form>
  <FormField>
    <Label>Email</Label>
    <Input type="email" />
  </FormField>
  <Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>
</Form>
```

### Accessibility Built-In

Accessibility is not optional—it's built into every component:

```jsx
// Icon-only buttons automatically get aria-label support
<Button variant="ghost" aria-label="Close">×</Button>

// Form fields include proper labeling
<Input aria-label="Search" placeholder="Search..." />
```

## Philosophy: Beautiful by Default

The core principle that guides everything:

**Every component is beautiful without configuration.**

This means AI-generated UIs are:
- Visually stunning out of the box
- Consistent across the entire system
- Work in both light and dark modes
- Scale responsively from mobile to desktop
- Follow accessibility standards automatically

When AI generates component code with UI Lab, the result is production-ready—no tweaking needed.

# Agents & MCPs

UI Lab is built from the ground up with AI as a first-class citizen. Our component system is designed to make it easy for AI systems—whether Claude, custom agents, or other LLMs—to generate beautiful, production-ready code.

## Core Principles

### Beautiful by Default
Every component is beautiful without configuration. AI-generated UIs are:
- Visually consistent across the entire system
- Work in both light and dark modes
- Scale responsively from mobile to desktop
- Follow accessibility standards automatically

### Type-Safe & Composable
All components are fully typed TypeScript with clear composition patterns:

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="md">Save</Button>
<Input type="email" placeholder="your@email.com" />
<Select options={items} value={selected} onChange={setSelected} />
```

### Registry-Driven
A machine-readable registry describes every component:
- Variants and their purposes
- Accessibility features
- Design tokens and theming
- Related components
- Composition patterns

## What's Included

1. **Component Registry** – Structured metadata for all UI Lab components
2. **Design Guidelines** – Clear patterns for component selection and composition
3. **Type Definitions** – Full TypeScript support for generated code
4. **MCP Server** – Real-time integration with Claude and other LLMs

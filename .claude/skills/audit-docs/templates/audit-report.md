## Appendix: Evaluation Criteria

This audit evaluated documentation against four core questions:

1. **Is this helpful for the user?** - Does it provide real value?
2. **Is this fluff that can be optimized?** - Can it be more concise?
3. **Does this content serve a clear purpose?** - Why does it exist?
4. **Are there redundancies that can be eliminated?** - Is information repeated?

Each section was rated on:
- Helpfulness (Helpful / Somewhat Helpful / Not Helpful)
- Clarity & Brevity (Excellent / Good / Acceptable / Needs Work / Poor)
- Purpose (Clear / Somewhat Clear / Unclear / No Purpose)
- Redundancy (None / Minor / Moderate / Significant / Severe)
